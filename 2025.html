    <div id="gallery" class="gallery">
      <div class="book-card"><img src="images/meditations-by-marcus-aurelius.jpeg" alt="Cover of Meditations, by Marcus Aurelius" class="book-cover" loading="lazy"><div class="book-title">Meditations, by Marcus Aurelius</div><div class="book-notes">A mix of generic good advice and total nonsense. This is a disorganised assortment of fragments, not a coherent book. Mildly interesting but slow going. </div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><img src="images/on-the-shortness-of-life-by-seneca.jpeg" alt="Cover of On the Shortness of Life, by Seneca" class="book-cover" loading="lazy"><div class="book-title">On the Shortness of Life, by Seneca</div><div class="book-notes">Nicely phrased and I really enjoyed this – some excellent advice, and some bluster. Another Roman philosopher who thinks the best possible use of your time is to be a philosopher; quelle surprise.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><img src="images/submission-by-michel-houellebecq.jpeg" alt="Cover of Submission, by Michel Houellebecq" class="book-cover" loading="lazy"><div class="book-title">Submission, by Michel Houellebecq</div><div class="book-notes">In the near future, a Muslim party sweeps to power in France. We see society transform (and the women disappear) through the eyes of François, a depressed literature professor specialising in Huysmans. Provocative, amusing, spectacularly French.
</div><div class="book-link"><a href="https://x.com/levantophile/status/2000984928075571533?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">There is no Israel for me. →</a></div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><img src="images/cultish-by-amanda-montell.jpeg" alt="Cover of Cultish, by Amanda Montell" class="book-cover" loading="lazy"><div class="book-title">Cultish, by Amanda Montell</div><div class="book-notes">Interesting book on how cults, MLMs, and weirdly intense fitness instructors use language to attract and manipulate followers. Pretty superficial (and 3x the length it needs to be) but good fun.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><img src="images/till-we-have-faces-by-cs-lewis.jpeg" alt="Cover of Till We Have Faces, by CS Lewis" class="book-cover" loading="lazy"><div class="book-title">Till We Have Faces, by CS Lewis</div><div class="book-notes">The myth of Cupid and Psyche, retold by Psyche&#39;s jealous elder sister. A glimpse into the terror, wonder, and monstrous ambiguity of faith, with an uncanny quality that&#39;s deeply unnerving. I sometimes felt like I was trespassing by reading it.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><img src="images/there-are-rivers-in-the-sky-by-elif-shafak.jpeg" alt="Cover of There Are Rivers in the Sky, by Elif Shafak" class="book-cover" loading="lazy"><div class="book-title">There Are Rivers in the Sky, by Elif Shafak</div><div class="book-notes">By the banks of the Thames and the Tigris, three lives are connected by water, memory, persecution, and the Epic of Gilgamesh. Beautifully written &amp; lovingly researched – although I&#39;d have liked more Gilgamesh and less dodgy science.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><img src="images/the-moonlight-market-by-joanne-harris.jpeg" alt="Cover of The Moonlight Market, by Joanne Harris" class="book-cover" loading="lazy"><div class="book-title">The Moonlight Market, by Joanne Harris</div><div class="book-notes">A fun modern fairytale to read on the plane but extremely repetitive/silly/shallow in places. Mostly feels like it&#39;s written for young children – I suppose it&#39;s aimed at adult women who mostly read YA/romantasy.
</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><img src="images/the-vegetarian-by-han-kang.jpeg" alt="Cover of The Vegetarian, by Han Kang" class="book-cover" loading="lazy"><div class="book-title">The Vegetarian, by Han Kang</div><div class="book-notes">When Yeong-hye, a dutiful wife, stops eating meat – that is only the beginning of the trouble. This was viscerally unpleasant and disturbing, but strangely fascinating. A volley in the South Korean gender wars. Point to the women.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><img src="images/weight-by-jeanette-winterson.jpeg" alt="Cover of Weight, by Jeanette Winterson" class="book-cover" loading="lazy"><div class="book-title">Weight, by Jeanette Winterson</div><div class="book-notes">The story of Atlas holding up the world – and Heracles who takes up the burden briefly then tricks Atlas into taking it back. Interesting but shallow. Felt like reading a very long stream-of-consciousness blog post by someone quite self-involved.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><img src="images/the-virgin-suicides-by-jeffrey-eugenides.jpeg" alt="Cover of The Virgin Suicides, by Jeffrey Eugenides" class="book-cover" loading="lazy"><div class="book-title">The Virgin Suicides, by Jeffrey Eugenides</div><div class="book-notes">The neighbours boys chronicle their fascination with the five Lisbon sisters: watching the house, generating theories, and obsessively cataloguing stolen items. You can guess what happens to the girls. Read in one day; not sure why.
</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><img src="images/letters-to-a-young-poet-by-rainer-maria-rilke.jpeg" alt="Cover of Letters to a Young Poet, by Rainer Maria Rilke" class="book-cover" loading="lazy"><div class="book-title">Letters to a Young Poet, by Rainer Maria Rilke</div><div class="book-notes">Almost every letter in this book opens with an apology for taking so long to write. Extremely charming and intense sequence. I slightly wish I&#39;d read it as a teenager.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><img src="images/sunrise-on-the-reaping-by-suzanne-collins.jpeg" alt="Cover of Sunrise on the Reaping, by Suzanne Collins" class="book-cover" loading="lazy"><div class="book-title">Sunrise on the Reaping, by Suzanne Collins</div><div class="book-notes">This was a Hunger Games book and therefore I loved it. The recurring themes are starting to become overfamiliar, and there&#39;s less tension because you know what happens – that&#39;s okay, I&#39;ll still keep reading that garbage.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><img src="images/immortality-by-milan-kundera.jpeg" alt="Cover of Immortality, by Milan Kundera" class="book-cover" loading="lazy"><div class="book-title">Immortality, by Milan Kundera</div><div class="book-notes">Slower going than The Unbearable Lightness of Being (I almost stopped reading!) but in the end I enjoyed it just as much. Long and meandering, too postmodern for my tastes, but full of excellent paragraphs. The Goethe chapters are particularly good.
</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><img src="images/a-chess-story-by-stefan-zweig.jpeg" alt="Cover of A Chess Story, by Stefan Zweig" class="book-cover" loading="lazy"><div class="book-title">A Chess Story, by Stefan Zweig</div><div class="book-notes">It&#39;s a story about chess, can&#39;t say fairer than that. Hard to say anything else without spoiling it. I liked it.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><img src="images/journey-by-moonlight-by-antal-szerb.jpeg" alt="Cover of Journey By Moonlight, by Antal Szerb" class="book-cover" loading="lazy"><div class="book-title">Journey By Moonlight, by Antal Szerb</div><div class="book-notes">Finding himself restless and agitated on honeymoon in Italy, Mihály makes a series of unexpected decisions driven by fear, neuroticism, and nostalgia for his intense and unconventional teenage friendships. I read this in one day, totally hypnotised, and sat stunned and wounded for hours afterwards. </div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><img src="images/the-pendragon-legend-by-antal-szerb.jpeg" alt="Cover of The Pendragon Legend, by Antal Szerb" class="book-cover" loading="lazy"><div class="book-title">The Pendragon Legend, by Antal Szerb</div><div class="book-notes">A young Hungarian scholar visits Britain, where a chance meeting with a Welsh aristocrat draws him into a web of intrigue featuring long-dead alchemists, vengeful ghosts, and a secret dungeon full of axolotls. Extremely amusing.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><img src="images/triumph-and-disaster-five-historical-miniatures-by-stefan-zweig.jpeg" alt="Cover of Triumph and Disaster: Five Historical Miniatures, by Stefan Zweig" class="book-cover" loading="lazy"><div class="book-title">Triumph and Disaster: Five Historical Miniatures, by Stefan Zweig</div><div class="book-notes">Another banger from Zweig. Scott&#39;s doomed expedition, the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans, Lenin&#39;s journey to Russia in a sealed train – all excellent bedtime stories for aspiring Great Men of History.

      <div class="book-card"><img src="images/the-world-of-yesterday-by-stefan-zweig.jpeg" alt="Cover of The World of Yesterday, by Stefan Zweig" class="book-cover" loading="lazy"><div class="book-title">The World of Yesterday, by Stefan Zweig</div><div class="book-notes">Heartbreaking elegy for pre-WWI Vienna. Zweig writes very movingly about what was lost in the world wars, and his own statelessness after fleeing Austria.
