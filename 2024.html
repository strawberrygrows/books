    </div>
    <div id="gallery" class="gallery">
      <div class="book-card"><img src="images/the-unbearable-lightness-of-being-by-milan-kundera.jpeg" alt="Cover of The Unbearable Lightness of Being, by Milan Kundera" class="book-cover" loading="lazy"><div class="book-title">The Unbearable Lightness of Being, by Milan Kundera</div><div class="book-notes">An old favourite which has affected my inner monologue as few books do. A friend asked me recently: what inner conflicts/tension am I carrying with me that I won&#39;t resolve? About half of them are in here.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><img src="images/the-happy-couple-by-naoise-dolan.jpeg" alt="Cover of The Happy Couple, by Naoise Dolan" class="book-cover" loading="lazy"><div class="book-title">The Happy Couple, by Naoise Dolan</div><div class="book-notes">Practically inhaled this today. Was almost late to a dinner party in my own house because I read 170 pages in one sitting and forgot time was passing. Couldn&#39;t really tell you why.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><img src="images/confusion-by-stefan-zweig.jpeg" alt="Cover of Confusion, by Stefan Zweig" class="book-cover" loading="lazy"><div class="book-title">Confusion, by Stefan Zweig</div><div class="book-notes">When you have a long train journey on a warm day – you can&#39;t do better than a short book about Shakespeare &amp; repressed passion. Zweig is fast becoming my favourite writer.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><img src="images/hillbilly-elegy-by-j-d-vance.jpeg" alt="Cover of Hillbilly Elegy, by J. D. Vance" class="book-cover" loading="lazy"><div class="book-title">Hillbilly Elegy, by J. D. Vance</div><div class="book-notes">Vance&#39;s story of his difficult upbringing, neatly (&amp; some might say cynically) packaged to support his political career. Makes his case for the importance of stable, loving families, and the value of good networks. Highly readable.
</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><img src="images/genius-and-discovery-five-historical-miniatures-by-stefan-zweig.jpeg" alt="Cover of Genius and Discovery: Five Historical Miniatures, by Stefan Zweig" class="book-cover" loading="lazy"><div class="book-title">Genius and Discovery: Five Historical Miniatures, by Stefan Zweig</div><div class="book-notes">From Handel writing Messiah to the laying of the first transatlantic telegraph cable – Zweig narratives five &quot;fateful hours&quot; in the history of mankind. I loved this book, it&#39;s a little gem.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><img src="images/penance-by-eliza-clarke.jpeg" alt="Cover of Penance, by Eliza Clarke" class="book-cover" loading="lazy"><div class="book-title">Penance, by Eliza Clarke</div><div class="book-notes">Three teenage girls commit a horrifying murder. Extremely fucked-up. Couldn&#39;t put it down. This must be how it feels to get obsessed with true crime. Interestingly, the first novel I&#39;ve read where characters have Tumblr accounts.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><img src="images/beware-of-pity-by-stefan-zweig.jpeg" alt="Cover of Beware of Pity, by Stefan Zweig" class="book-cover" loading="lazy"><div class="book-title">Beware of Pity, by Stefan Zweig</div><div class="book-notes">Compelling account of an Austrian cavalry officer in 1913 who makes a series of increasingly terrible decisions, after accidentally offending a lame girl by asking her to dance. I was yelling aloud in frustration with this absurd man. Great book.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><img src="images/in-memoriam-by-alice-winn.jpeg" alt="Cover of In Memoriam, by Alice Winn" class="book-cover" loading="lazy"><div class="book-title">In Memoriam, by Alice Winn</div><div class="book-notes">WWI romance between two permanently distraught teenage boys – at boarding school and in the trenches. Mawkish and shallow. Still cried my eyes out. Full of obituaries.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><img src="images/tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow-by-gabrielle-zevin.jpeg" alt="Cover of Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow, by Gabrielle Zevin" class="book-cover" loading="lazy"><div class="book-title">Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow, by Gabrielle Zevin</div><div class="book-notes">A shockingly good book about video games, friendship, and things going wrong. Tried to read it in the living room on holiday, but started crying and had to exile myself.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><img src="images/bruges-la-morte-by-georges-rodenbach.jpeg" alt="Cover of Bruges-la-Morte, by Georges Rodenbach " class="book-cover" loading="lazy"><div class="book-title">Bruges-la-Morte, by Georges Rodenbach </div><div class="book-notes">A melancholy portrait of grief &amp; obsession in a dead city. First published 1892 &amp; thought to be the first work of fiction illustrated with photographs. Completely mesmerising: I read it in 2 days.</div><div class="book-link"><a href="Revisiting Bruges-la-Morte" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting Bruges-la-Morte →</a></div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><img src="images/cleopatra-and-frankenstein-by-coco-mellors.jpeg" alt="Cover of Cleopatra and Frankenstein, by Coco Mellors" class="book-cover" loading="lazy"><div class="book-title">Cleopatra and Frankenstein, by Coco Mellors</div><div class="book-notes">An impulsive marriage fractures and disintegrates. Vibey &amp; interesting throughout but it didn&#39;t hit like I wanted it to.
