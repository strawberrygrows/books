      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The Lessons, by Naomi Alderman</div><div class="book-notes">Like Brideshead Revisited and The Secret History happening at the same time. Nothing much new, but I enjoyed both of those and I enjoyed this too. And it&#39;s very readable, raced through it in three evenings.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">High-Rise, by J.G. Ballard</div><div class="book-notes">This book is essentially Lord of the Flies for adults. Instead of a paradise island, it&#39;s a spectacularly expensive but poorly-designed tower block in Docklands area of London.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The central message of this book is that human civilisation is a construction and to an extent a performance, and therefore more fragile than we like to accept. The architecture, the isolation, and the savagery and tragedies that unfold in the High Rise, are all intimately connected. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is some truth to this; evidence does suggest that people who live in impersonal tower blocks experience a whole host of issues from behavioural problems in children, lower reported life satisfaction and less empathy with neighbours.  This book represents this taken to its logical extreme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The constant self-analysis is a little obtrusive, characters sometimes feel like mouthpieces for the author (or the reader&#39;s GCSE English teacher). The author&#39;s habit of referring to individuals by their job titles is poignant in the face of the chaos but actually quite irritating especially when the POV character clearly does not know the person.  Some scenes are profoundly uncomfortable, which is maybe 70% to do with the scene being described and 30% the deliberately awkward metaphors applied.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The Silence of the Girls, by Pat Barker</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The Idiot, by Elif Batuman</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">Social Creature, by Tara Isabella Burton</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">If on a Winter&#39;s Night a Traveler, by Italo Calvino</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The Girls, by Emma Cline</div><div class="book-notes">A romantic examination of the adolescent imagination: an insecure teenage girl, obsessed with aesthetics, who sees ugliness everywhere. Drawn into a cult, mostly for the other girls rather than the charismatic male leader. A bit miserable but utterly compelling.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The Sorrows of Satan, by Marie Corelli</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The Meursault Investigation, by Kamel Daoud</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">A Journal of the Plague Year, by Daniel Defoe</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">Exciting Times, by Naoise Dolan</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">Notes from the Underground, by Fyodor Dostoevsky</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The House of the Dead, by Fyodor Dostoevsky</div><div class="book-notes">This book is a striking account of Dostoevsky&#39;s time in prison in Siberia. The main takeaway is that prison in Siberia is really, really, boring and miserable.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">I, Lucifer, by Glen Duncan</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The Prague Cemetery, by Umberto Eco</div><div class="book-notes">This is a marvellous book, a labyrinthine and only-moderately falsified history of European anti-semitism, conspiracies and forgeries. Surprisingly amusing in parts, as our joyless narrator obliviously presents opportunities for us to judge and mock his more lighthearted weird behaviour. He is very much a piece of shit from Page 1. And if you don&#39;t want to spend a couple of hundred pages reading violent anti-semitic tirades, I can hardly blame you.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The Name of the Rose, by Umberto Eco</div><div class="book-notes">&#39;William of Baskerville&#39; - the Holmes-like protagonist, and Adso of Melk, his German narrator, are two monks who come to an Italian abbey on a diplomatic mission for the Holy Roman Emperor.  Upon arriving they find themselves tangled in heretical schemes and political machinations, as they try to solve a series of ghastly murders unfolding over a single week.  At the centre is the library; a forbidden labyrinth which looms over the abbey and seems to be the key to solving these crimes.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is phenomenal: full of theological, literary, philosophical political ideas, and long discourses on these subjects scattered among the twin central plots of murder and diplomacy.  Read it!</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The Eyre Affair, by Jasper Fforde</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">Howard&#39;s End, by E.M. Forster</div><div class="book-notes">A sweet and straightforward book that I enjoyed very much.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">A Room With a View, by E.M. Forster</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">North and South, by Elizabeth Gaskell</div><div class="book-notes">Class war, but every time someone proposes or dies it gets slower. Lots of sweet everyday details and a great depiction of characters&#39; inner lives, but you may as well watch the BBC adaptation which gets everything right except the end.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The Talented Mr. Ripley, by Patricia Highsmith</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The Price of Salt, or Carol, by Patricia Highsmith</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">Les Misérables, by Victor Hugo</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The Hunchback of Notre-Dame, by Victor Hugo</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">Against Nature, by Joris-Karl Huysmans</div><div class="book-notes">Authentic decadence turns out to be fairly boring and involve a lot of shopping. He bought a tortoise to match his carpet, and then had the tortoise gilded and encrusted with jewels so that it matches better. The poor tortoise is never acknowledged for the rest of the novel. I worry about that tortoise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;N.B. I read a translation by Margaret Mauldon.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The Trial, by Franz Kafka</div><div class="book-notes">I read this book because I was going to Prague. I did not enjoy it and I learned nothing.  I am probably missing something.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">Lady Chatterley&#39;s Lover, by D. H. Lawrence</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The Invisible Hook, by Peter T. Leeson</div></div>

      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The World My Wilderness, by Rose Macaulay</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">Tell Them of Battles, Kings, and Elephants, by Mathias Énard, Charlotte Mandell</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The Lost Books of the Odyssey, by Zachary Mason</div><div class="book-notes">Comparisons to Invisible Cities are entirely justified. Like its protagonist, this book is complicated, clever, and never the same thing twice.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">Metamorphica, by Zachary Mason</div><div class="book-notes">It was no &quot;Lost books of the Odyssey&quot;, but I enjoyed this a lot.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">Circe, by Madeline Miller</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The Night Circus, by Erin Morgenstern</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">My Year of Rest and Relaxation, by Ottessa Moshfegh</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The Argonauts, by Maggie Nelson</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">Starter For Ten, by David Nicholls</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The Bell Jar, by Sylvia Plath</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">His Dark Materials, by Philip Pullman</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">Housekeeping, by Marilynne Robinson</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">Normal People, by Sally Rooney</div><div class="book-notes">This book fucked me up.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">Indiana, by George Sand</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The Book of Dead Days, by Marcus Sedgwick</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The Marvels, by Brian Selznick</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">Crush, by Richard Siken</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The Pendragon Legend, by Antal Szerb</div><div class="book-notes">Extremely funny and pleasant book, more akin to Scooby Doo than Dracula.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The Goldfinch, by Donna Tartt</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The Daughter of Time, by Josephine Tey</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The Elizabethan World Picture, by Eustace Mandeville Wetenhall Tillyard</div><div class="book-notes">A wonderful book if you are specifically interested in Elizabethan theology and philosophy specifically as expressed through poetry. Probably not for the general reader. I loved it though, it was a little slow in places but overall I found it a lucid explanation of an elegant and appealing world system.  The whole conceptual framework is immensely racist though, which the book kind of alludes to without properly addressing.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy</div><div class="book-notes">Bit long.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The Hare With Amber Eyes, by Edmund de Waal</div><div class="book-notes">This book changed the way I think about beauty - for the better.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">Brideshead Revisited, by Evelyn Waugh</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The First Men in the Moon, by H.G. Wells</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The House of Mirth, by Edith Wharton</div><div class="book-notes">This book was full of exciting, Gossip Girl style machinations, and gave me a sense of what it would feel like not to be real. I read this at a difficult time and when I reached the ending I threw the book across the room as was furious. It&#39;s a good novel, though.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The Picture of Dorian Gray, by Oscar Wilde</div><div class="book-notes">This book is totally captivating and gets under your skin in a mostly-good sort of way. I worry it made me briefly shallower but that shallowness was an immense comfort in a difficult time of my life.</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The Gap of Time, by Jeanette Winterson</div></div>
      <div class="book-card"><div class="book-title">The Republic of Pirates, by Colin Woodard</div></div>
